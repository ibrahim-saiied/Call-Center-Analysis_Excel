## Case Study
NBE call center supports many customers across different regions and receives a high number of calls every day. lately, the company has received complaints about long waiting times and poor service, some customers have even stopped using the service because of these issues.

Before growing the business further, the management team asked for an Excel dashboard to track important performance indicators like Answer Rate, Service Level, First Call Resolution (FCR), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and peak call times.
The main goal is to understand where the problems are, improve team scheduling, and provide better service using clear and simple data.

## Main ùêäùêèùêàùê¨
- **<ins>Service Level (%)</ins>**: (Target: > 91.5%) Percentage of calls answered within your target time (30s).
- **<ins>Answer Rate (%)</ins>**: (Target: > 95%) Percentage of calls answered vs. total calls received.
- **<ins>Hold Time (%)</ins>**: (Target: < 10%) Percentage of time callers wait on hold from total in the call after answering. 
- **<ins>First Call Resolution (FCR %)</ins>**: (Target: > 80%) Percentage of problems solved in the first call.
- **<ins>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT %)</ins>**: (Target: > 4.4) Rating of Satisfaction customers (rated 1-5 stars).
- **<ins>Average Handle Time (AHT)</ins>**: (Target: < 10:30) Average time agents spend per call without waiting time.

## Process
1) Explored and validated the call center data
2) Imported and cleaned data using Power Query with helper columns
3) Built a data model
4) Created key measures using DAX (e.g., SL, FCR, CSAT)
5) Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize insights

## Important Insights
 1) **Service Level is On Target**
    - At 92.0%, we‚Äôre meeting our goal (91.5%), showing good responsiveness, but we need to keep monitoring performance on certain days.
 3) **Hold Time** 
    - Current hold rate is 10.8%, exceeding the 10% target. Process optimization may help reduce this
 3) **First Call Resolution (FCR)**
    - We achieved 92.1% FCR, which is well above the target (80%). This means most customer issues are solved on the first call a strong sign of quality service.
4) **Answer Rate Needs Improvement**
    - Current rate is 93.2%, slightly below the 95% target. This means we need to improve staffing or efficiency during busy hours.
 5) **Peak Hour is 3‚Äì4 PM**
    - The highest call volume occurs between 3:00 and 4:00 PM with over 2,450 calls. This is a key time to ensure strong agent coverage.
 6) **Sunday & Saturday weekends volume & performance**
    - Saturday and Sunday show 100% service level, mainly due to very low call volume and sufficient staffing.
 7) **Customer Inquiries & Resolution Rate**
    - The resolution rate is highest for Tech Support (80.2%) and slightly lower for Billing and Complaints (78‚Äì79%).
 8) **Some agents rated below target**
    - A few agents didn‚Äôt meet the target in several KPIs like rating, AHT, and hold %. This shows they may need more training or support to improve their performance.
